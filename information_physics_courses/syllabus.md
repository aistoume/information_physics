 - Probability
 - Observation
 - Estimation
- Statistical Physics
 - Statistical ensemble
 - Single particle system
 - Statistical equilibrium
 - Entropy
- Binary System
 - Multiplicity function g(N, s) = N! / ((N/2 + s)! * (N/2 - s)!), where "!" denotes factorial
 - Energy of each state e0, e1
 - Total energy E= n0 * e0 + n1 * e1
 - Denote n is the number of ‘particles’
 - V is the configuration/ order of n particles
 - U is the energy of system
 - Information contact => energy exchange, but n doesn’t change, V doesn’t change.
 - T is energy per particle. 
 - G(U, n, V) = G(U1, n1, V1) * G(U-U1, n2, V2)
 - Define T. When information contact is equalibrium, dG(U, n, V)/dU = 0

Statistical physics and quantum physics are the art of connecting micro uncertainty to macro certainty by using mathematical models. On another hand, information is a material reducing uncertainty and leading to a certain conclusion. If we can characterize the information as physical variable, the information can be computed by a function. 

An unique number can represent a unique piece of information. In thermal physics, the continuous number means the variable is comparable and there is physical meaning by comparing their values. The information variable is more like quantum. Each encoded information represent a ‘logical meaning’ to human, like ‘I wake up morning’ vs. ‘I eat breakfast’. It’s unreasonable to compare these 2 pieces of information. 

But, if we modify the ‘I eat breakfast’ -> ‘I eat a breakfast’ or ‘I eat the breakfast’ or ‘breakfast, I eat’, the information represents the same meaning in some situations and the readers can catch its meaning from the source. In this case, we can define a group of information whose representations are the same, like 1.0 is almost the same as 1.0000000001. 

Like wave function, the information ‘base’ is orthogonal but it’s meaningful to compare their coefficients.
